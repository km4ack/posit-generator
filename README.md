# POSIT GENERATOR

This script allows you to build a posit (pos) file for:

Winlink VARA HF Gateways
Winlink VARA FM Gateways
Winlink Packet Gateway
Voice Repeaters
POTA Parks

Once the pos file is created, it can be imported in YAAC where it will be placed on the map as an object.

# Install

git clone && cd posit-generator && bash install
```
